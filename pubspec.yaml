# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/roboto/Roboto-Black.ttf
        - asset: fonts/roboto/Roboto-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/roboto/Roboto-Light.ttf
        - asset: fonts/roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf
          style: italic
    - family: RobotoConsode
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/robotoConsode/RobotoCondensed-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/robotoConsode/RobotoCondensed-Regular.ttf
